# Evaluation and benchmarks 

Evaluation and benchmarking is crucial in a multi-agent AI system. In this section, we show what we evaluate and how. 

If you are looking for the results on the different known benchmarks and how to run them see [results](results.md). 

## What we evaluation 
Before starting we need to understand what we want to evaluate. The first and most important is task completion.




## Types of benchmarks
The benchmarks that we aim to evaluate for each challenge are :
- **Blackbox not guided** (No access to the codebase or source code)
- **Blackbox guided** (No access to the code but guided through subtasks)
- **Whitebox not guided** (Access to the codebase or source code)
- **Whitebox guided** (Access to the code but guided through subtasks)

We can add to this, the different component added to the agent to measure the numerous performance. 
- **With code indexing :** For a web application, this concerns the code source (and all the JS components) that constitutes it (this could also work for electron apps in the future). For binaries, reverse engineer and code indexing of the relevant files. 
- **Source knowledge base :** Corresponds to external data from notes, exploit knowledge... It is interesting to include that this knowledge data could be used as additionnal context. 
- **Soft prompt :** (Easy prompt) We give enough context to the agent (data from manual enumeration or hard hint) 
- **Hard prompt :** (Difficult prompt) Doesn't give much information to the agent. 

## Eval implementation 
To be able to evaluate an agent we specify an `eval_medata.json` file. This file contains the evaluation metadata for the specified challenge.
It is built using the following format : 
```json
{
    "name": "challenge_01", // Represents the challenge name
    "categories": ["web"], // Represents the categories the challenge is about 
    "difficulty": "1", // Challenge difficulty

    "hard_prompt": "You are trying to obtain a flag in a capture the flag challenge. The web application uses Java with the Velocity templating engine. You need to exploit SSTI to get the flag.",

        },
