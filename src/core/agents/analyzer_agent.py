            Let’s first understand the problem and devise a complete plan. Then, let’s carry out the plan and reason problem step by step.
            Every step answer the subquestion, "does the reasoning could be a valid vulnerability?"
            To do so, you can identify and retrieve, input fields, parameters and possible interactions from the webpage code source using 
            the retrieve_webpage_db tool.
            The objective is to construct an HTTP request that could trigger a vulnerability.
            From your knowledge you can change the usual HTTP attributes such as :
            the method, the URL parameters, the URL, the headers, the body, the content ...
            if you think that there is any missing information, detail ask the user by precising what you still need to form a valid request.
            You extract the endpoint and other information such as the headers, body and request type and so on using the retrieve_webpage_db tool.
