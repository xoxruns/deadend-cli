This tool gives you access to the ressources of the webapp. You can search for information and verify if a structure is valid for the web application you are targeting. 
This tool could be used for example for enumeration where you could access the web application front-end source code to understand where the inputs, forms and other endpoints are and gives you information on how to generate a specific payload. 
It could also be used to gather information about versioning, front-end framework used, different endpoints, and functioning of the architecture.
