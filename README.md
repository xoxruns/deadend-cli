## What in the world is this ? 
Deadend CLI is a prototype AI Agent for security researchers, pentesters and developers. 

Inspired by Google Zero's project Naptime, this project aims to build a prototype of an agentic AI tool that helps gain time and give a better understanding on analysis.

## 🎯 Project Vision & Approach

> [!WARNING]
> **Evaluation in Progress**: This project is currently undergoing active evaluation and testing across multiple vulnerability types (OWASP Top 10, business logic flaws, authentication bypasses, etc.). Results, performance metrics, and capabilities may vary significantly during this development phase. Do not use in Production environments.

Deadend CLI represents a new paradigm in automated security testing, designed to bridge the gap between traditional static/dynamic analysis tools and the nuanced, context-aware analysis that experienced security professionals perform.

### Current State & Development Philosophy

While the current implementation leverages workflow automation and tool orchestration, the project's core innovation lies in its **AI-assisted vulnerability analysis system**. By combining intelligent code indexing with contextual retrieval mechanisms, Deadend CLI aims to provide deeper insights than traditional automated scanners.

### Core Analysis Capabilities

The framework focuses on **intelligent security analysis** through:

- **🔍 Taint Analysis**: Automated tracking of data flow from sources to sinks
- **🎯 Source/Sink Detection**: Intelligent identification of entry points and vulnerable functions
- **🔗 Contextual Tool Integration**: Smart connection to specialized tools for testing complex logic patterns
- **🧠 AI-Driven Reasoning**: Context-aware analysis that mimics expert security thinking

### Target Scope & Limitations

**Primary Focus**: Web applications and APIs

**Complementary Approach**: Deadend CLI is designed to **enhance**, not replace, existing SAST/DAST tools. It specifically targets vulnerabilities that require human-like reasoning and context understanding:

- **🔐 Broken Access Controls**: Complex authorization bypass scenarios
- **🆔 IDOR Vulnerabilities**: Indirect object reference exploitation patterns  
- **⚙️ Business Logic Flaws**: Application-specific logic vulnerabilities
- **🔄 State Management Issues**: Session and authentication state manipulation
- **📊 Data Validation Bypasses**: Complex input validation circumvention

This approach enables discovery of vulnerabilities that traditional scanners often miss due to their inability to understand application context and business logic.
